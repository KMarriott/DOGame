RPG Idea

==============================================

Fix up CSS

Make a proper victory/Loss Page

Write Heal/Defense/Stance Change/Charge

Make Next Button Bigger when it appears
	-Give next button an idle animation
Hide other buttons

Add animation
	-floating animation for hover over (enemy, characters, buttons)
	-Character moving forward for attack

Control with arrow keys!

Make a dice roll for bonuses/Include animation?

Write character Passives (see below)
Enable Multiple enemies

(Function/methods)
-Select attacks
-Select skills
	- Skills are more effective but cost cost mp
	- Have cooldowns rather than mp?
	- Both?
-Health


Damage Calculation:
Attack * (random number betweeen 0.9 and 1.25) - Opponents Armor

Turn Queue
Characters are randomly placed on quue based off Speed.
After an action they are placed at the end of a queue.
High Speed characters can attack twice if they're lucky?

UI
characters on right, enemy on left

Replace commands with "Spawn new enemy"
Keep a score of total experience in the bottom left. (DP?)


MVP:
Turned based boss fight.


Characters:

Castor - Fighter 
Abby - Healer 
Konrad - Paladin 
Chie - Brawler
Todd - Thief 

(Stats were changed)

Characters Passive - 
Castor - Progressively gets stronger
Abby - Better dice roles/Higher range with RNG / Makes Opponents Dice Range Lower
Chie - Chance for double hit/Reroll dodges
Konrad - ???
Recovers HP
Todd - ???
Always goes third



Future Ideas:
Equipment
Allow for multiple enemies if time allows.
Overworld if time allows.
Items
Leveling up - Gaining Experience
-Experience Between fights
-Transform to change stats
-Summons
Rounds of Fights
Enemies change behavior depending on health
Have animation showing amount of damage
Passive Effect for Characters?
Missing characters for certain fights?
Buffs for certain fights?


Base it off encounters in DO
-evolve as you reach that point in the story
